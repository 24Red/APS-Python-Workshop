# APS Python Workshop

## What's In this Repository
* **files** contains 3 data files you will use during the workshop
* **workshop_scripts** contains the Python scripts for this workshop. These are what you will be running. 
* **workshop_notebooks** contains the same Python codes as **workshop_scripts**, but they are formatted in a better way for notebook-style IDEs such as Jupyter Notebook. 
* **README.md** is the file that creates this description

## Getting Started: 
* Install Jupyter Notebook, which is a part of the [Anaconda Distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual). Make sure that you have or download the Python 3.7 version. 
(This workshop will be conducted with Jupyter Notebook. However, if you are already familiar with Python, you may use the IDE of your choice.)
* Install the packages listed below 
* Download the files in this repository to your computer. To do so, click the green "Clone or Download" button above and select "Download ZIP." You will need to **unzip** the download before you can open the files on your computer. 

## Packages
You will need each of the following Python packages:
* Numpy
* SciPy
* Matplotlib
* Pandas
* Astropy

To download each of the package, go to the **Command Line** (Windows) or **Terminal** (Mac). Then, type ```pip install package_name``` (where the package name is all lowercase) and press ```enter```. If you are using the Anaconda Distribution, you can also use ```conda install package_name```.

For example, to download NumPy, use ```pip install numpy```.
